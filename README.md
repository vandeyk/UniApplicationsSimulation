# UniApplicationsSimulation
The repository contains the data for the paper "Spectral Theory for Multidimensional Digital Data Matrices' Processing" [1].
The data was extracted from the sets published by HSE, it contains average unified exam scores among freshmen who enrolled under government paid tuition to 9 engineering programs at 47 universities in 2020 and 2021 - the tables "Application data 2020" and "Application data 2021". Raw data can be found at [2].
The "ESDF" table contains the energy spectral density function (ESDF) derived from the two tables of application data.
The "Simulated data" tables contain the results of simulating signals based on the ESDF in Fourier and Hartley bases correspondingly.
